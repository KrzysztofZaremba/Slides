histogram of residuals from normal

histogram of residuals from uniform 

histogram of residuals from student t with 2





###plot 1,2,3

different quantiles of normal distribution 


### plot 3

Simulate data from normal distribution,

Standardize it?
  tive normal distribution will plot as a straight line. Let t[1] < t[2] < . . . < t[n] be the
externally studentized residuals ranked in increasing order. If we plot t[i] against the
cumulative probability Pi = âˆ’ ( ) i n 1
2 / , i = 1, 2, . . . , n , on t

table with both - they should be more or less the same, (start with like 3 observations)

table with both - all observations together - normal, quantile, sample

which graphically means they should be on the same line

determine the quantiles and put them ona  graph 

###let's see what r does on qqplot and let follow it

### plot 4

- show residuals from uniform distribution

- show histogram of these residuals

- build a table1

exercice some other distributions, maybe right skeewd
