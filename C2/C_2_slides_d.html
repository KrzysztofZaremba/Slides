##Comparisions

- Descriptive and visual comparisons

--
- NOT declaring statistically significant differences, just eyeballing

--
- That's coming next


---

###Comparing categorical variables

####Do people living in rural areas are more likely to have diabetes?

- We have two categorical variables
- We can use frequency table to see how diabetes is distributed among the two types of areas:

&lt;table class="table table-striped" style="width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt;   &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; No Diabetes &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Has Diabetes &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Rural &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 8906 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 993 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Urban &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 24780 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 3179 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;



---
###Comparing categorical variables

####Do people living in rural areas are more likely to have diabetes?

- Are relative frequencies more helpful?
- Share of each subgroup within the sample



&lt;table class="table table-striped" style="width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt;   &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; No Diabetes &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Has Diabetes &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Total &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Rural &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.24 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.03 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.27 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Urban &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.65 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.08 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.73 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Total &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.89 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.11 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 1.00 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

--

- Can we compare numbers in the *Has Diabetes* column?

--
- **Marginal frequencies** are total probabilities by group


---


#### Table of frequency


- We want to compare whether someone living in rural area is more likely to have diabetes than someone living in urban area

--
- So we want to see whether: $$ \scriptsize P(Diabetes_i=1|Area_i=Rural)&gt;P(Diabetes_i=1|Area_i=Urban)$$

--
- We want to look at the **relative conditional frequencies**
- They are usually in **contingency tables**
  - Share with diabetes within urban sample
  - Share with diabetes within rural sample


--
&lt;table class="table table-striped" style="width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt;   &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; No Diabetes &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Has Diabetes &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Rural &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.90 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.10 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Urban &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.89 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.11 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

$$ \scriptsize P(Diabetes_i=1|Area_i=Rural)=\scriptsize \frac{ P(Diabetes_i=1 \cap Area_i=Rural) }{P(Area_i=Rural)}\approx\frac{0.03}{0.03+0.24} \approx 0.1$$
Or:

$$ \scriptsize P(Diabetes_i=1|Area_i=Rural)=\scriptsize \frac{ \text{Number live in Rural &amp; Have diabetes} }{\text{Number live in Rural}}=\frac{993}{993+8906} \approx 0.1$$

---

&lt;table class="table table-striped" style="width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt;   &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; No Diabetes &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Has Diabetes &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Rural &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.90 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.10 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Urban &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.89 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.11 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

--
- What about marginal frequencies here?
  - Row sums should add up to 1
      - `\(\scriptsize P(Diabetes_i=1|\text{Area=Rural}_i)+P(Diabetes_i=0|\text{Area=Urban}_i)\)`
  - Column sums are meaningless
      - `\(\scriptsize P(Diabetes_i=1|\text{Area=Rural}_i)+P(Diabetes_i=1|\text{Area=Urban}_i)\)`



---
- We can visualize it on a barplot

###Practice

- Are you more likely to have diabetes if your mother had diabetes?
- By how much?

&lt;table class="table table-striped" style="width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt;   &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; No Diabetes &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Has Diabetes &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Mother No Diabetes &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 25270 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 2427 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Mother Has Diabetes &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 8283 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 1721 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Mother Has Diabetes &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.83 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.17 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

- Does it mean that having diabetic mother **causes** higher change of having diabetes?

### One quantitative and one categorical


- For quantitative variables we can compare some summary statistics
 - Are people with diabetes older than people without it?

--
 - *Example* means in two subpopulations

### One quantitative and one categorical

- Or we can do Box and Whiskers plots as before
- Or we can compare the whole distributions of frequencies

&lt;img src="C_2_slides_d_files/figure-html/2g-1.png" width="100%" /&gt;

---
#### One quantitative and one categorical
- For continuous variables we can use the same methods (except frequency distribution) 
- Instead, we can compare densities or histograms
- Are men heavier than women?

### Associations: Two Quantitative Variables


- Likely people would subscribe to the website to lose weight

--

- But do these people have resources?

--

- What is the relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI) and Income?

--

- More generally, how to measure .blue[association between two quantitative variables]

--

- Association between qualitative variables is measured with contingency tables 



---
### Associations

- Suppose we surveyed people from Guadalajara and CDMX about their .blue[BMI], .blue[education] and .blue[income]. 
- Scatter plots show associations between two quantitative variables
  - We put variables of interest (*example*: Y and X) on the axis
  - We place observation on the cartesian plane using their values of variable X and Y: `\(\{(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2)..\}\)`
- In our case: 
    - X axis is BMI
    - Y axis is Income
    - An individual `\(i\)` is placed on these axis based on `\((BMI_i, Income_i)\)`

### Assocations

- Would you say that the relationship is stronger in Guadalajara or in Mexico City?

&lt;img src="C_2_slides_d_files/figure-html/2h-1.png" width="80%" /&gt;

- How to measure the strength of the relationship?

---
### Associations
#### Covariance

- **Covariance** measures the strength of the relationship between two variables. 

`$$\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu_X)(y_i - \mu_Y)$$`

And it's sample equivalent is: 

`$$\hat{\text{Cov}}(X, Y) = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$$`
--
- Covariance whether the two variables move together

--
- Covariance increases when:
  - The relationship is stronger
  - The deviations of variables are larger

### Covariance

- What has stronger relationship with Income: BMI or Years of Education?

&lt;img src="C_2_slides_d_files/figure-html/2zzza-1.png" width="100%" /&gt;

- BMI has larger covariance

--
- But we can't compare covariances of different variables

--
- Covariance depends on the scales (or units) of the variable

--
- All else equal, larger standard deviation implies larger covariance
  - The squares are just bigger

---

### Correlation

- **Correlation measures** the strength of a linear relationship between two variables.
- It ranges between -1 and 1 

**Population Correlation coefficient**:
`$$\rho(X, Y) = \frac{\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\sigma_X \cdot \sigma_Y}$$`


**Sample Correlation coefficient**:

`$$\hat{\rho}(X, Y) = \frac{\hat{\text{Cov}}(X, Y)}{s_X \cdot s_Y}$$`
Where `\(s_X = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}\)`


---
### Correlation

- Correlation is preferred over covariance because it's **scale-independent** and easier to interpret.
- Suppose that instead of measuring income (Y variable) in MXN , we measure it in Dollars. 
 - `\(Z\)` income in dollars `\(Z=\frac{Y}{16}\)`
 
--
- Is `\(Cov(X,Z)=Cov(X,Y)\)`?

`\begin{align*}
cov(X,Z) &amp;=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu_X)(z_i - \mu_Z) \\
&amp;=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu_X)(\frac{y_i}{16}- \frac{\mu_Y}{16}) \\
&amp;=\frac{1}{16}\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu_X)(y_i- \mu_Y) \\
&amp; \neq cov(X,Y)
\end{align*}`

`\begin{align*}
\rho(X,Z) &amp;=\frac{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu_X)(z_i - \mu_Z))}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu_X)^2} \cdot \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (z_i - \mu_Z)^2}} \\
&amp;=\frac{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu_X)(\frac{y_i}{16}- \frac{\mu_Y}{16})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu_X)^2} \cdot \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\frac{y_i}{16} - \frac{\mu_Y}{16})^2}} \\
&amp;=\frac{\frac{1}{16} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu_X)(y_i- \mu_Y)}{\frac{1}{16} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu_X)^2} \cdot \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \mu_Y)^2}} \\
&amp; = \rho(X,Y)
\end{align*}`

### Correlation

- Correlation with education is actually stronger

3. No linear correlation: `\(\rho = 0\)`, but this doesn't imply independence.

--
4. Correlation measures **linear** relationships; nonlinear relationships might not be accurately captured.

--
5. Correlation doesn't imply causation; a relationship could be coincidental.

### Causality vs Correlation
- Less obvious examples
- You look at historical data from some media campaign
- You notice that people who were more exposed to ads were less likely to buy that product
- What can you conclude?

--
- Are people who were exposed to ads similar to people who were not?

--
- Maybe they were targeted in the first place because they are less likely to buy and you want to change it?

### Causality vs Correlation
- Less obvious examples
- Education usually correlates with Income (correlation)

- Does it mean that if decide to get a degree, you will earn more? (causality)
