# Confidence Intervals

---
### Confidence Intervals

- We calculated the mean price in our sample

- How confident are we that our estimates close to the parameter's value?

- Confidence intervals measure uncertainty around the estimate

---
### Sampling distribution

- Consider a hypothetical sampling distribution of a sample mean
  - Again, this is never actually observed in practice
- If we draw samples repeatedly, 95% of their means will be within the shaded area 
- Why 1.96?

---
### Sampling distribution

- Assume we have `\(n&gt;30\)`
  - CLT applies and `\(\bar{X} \sim N(\mu_X, \frac{\sigma_X}{n})\)` 

--
- We want to find `\(k_1\)` and `\(k_2\)`, such that:
  - `\(P(k_1&lt;\bar{X}&lt;k_2)=0.95\)`, so
  
--
  - `\(P(\bar{X}&lt;k_1)=0.025\)` and `\(P(\bar{X}&gt;k_2)=0.025\)`  (or  `\(P(\bar{X}&lt;k_2)=0.975\)`)
  
--
- Trick is to standardize the variable:
  
`$$P(\bar{X}&lt;k_2)=P(\bar{X}-\mu_X&lt;k_2-\mu_X)=P(\underbrace{\frac{\bar{X}-\mu_X}{ \frac{\sigma_X}{n}}}_{Z \sim N(0,1)}&lt;\underbrace{\frac{k_2-\mu_X}{ \frac{\sigma_X}{n}}}_{k_2'})$$`
--
In probability tables, we can find `\(k_2'\)`, such that `\(P(Z&lt;k_2')=0.975\)` 

---
&lt;img src="C_3_slides_b_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="100%" /&gt;

- It's 97.5% quantile of standard normal: `\(k_2'=v_{0.975}^Z=1.96\)`. `\(P(Z&lt;v_{0.975})=P(Z&lt;1.96)=0.975\)`

--
- Let's go back to `\(k_2'=\frac{k_2-\mu_X}{ \frac{\sigma_X}{n}}\)`, from which we can back-out `\(k_2\)`

--
  - `\(k_2=\mu_X+\frac{\sigma_X}{n} k_2'=\mu_X+1.96\frac{\sigma_X}{n}\)`

--
- By symmetry of normal, `\(k'_1=-k'_2\)`, so `\(k_1=\mu_X+\frac{\sigma_X}{n} k_1'=\mu_X-1.96\frac{\sigma_X}{n}\)`


---
&lt;img src="C_3_slides_b_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="100%" /&gt;

- Another way to see it: 
  - Our variable is a linear transformation of a standard normal: `\(\bar{X}=\mu_X+\frac{\sigma_X}{n} Z\)`
  
--
  - So its percentiles are linear transformation of st.nor. quantiles:  `\(v_{0.975}^\bar{X}=\mu_X+\frac{\sigma_X}{n}v_{0.975}^Z\)`
---

### Sampling distribution

- Hence 95% of the draws of sample means will be within distance of `\(1.96\frac{\sigma_X}{n}\)` to the true parameter
- There is only 5% chance that we have draw sample weird enough that `\(\bar{X}\)` is further from `\(\mu_X\)` by more than `\(1.96\frac{\sigma_X}{n}\)`
- Confidence interval of `\(\bar{X}\)` will cover `\(\mu_X\)` as long as `\(|\mu_X-\bar{X}|&lt;1.96\frac{\sigma_X}{n}\)`

&lt;img src="C_3_slides_b_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="100%" /&gt;


---
### Sampling distribution

- Suppose we draw many samples from the same distribution
- For each sample we compute the sample mean and we construct the interval
- 95% of them will cover the true population mean!

### Calculation Procedure

Use this procedure if `\(n&gt;30\)`

1. Take an IID sample

--
2. Calculate mean `\(\bar{x}\)` and standard deviation `\(s\)`

--
3. Pick confidence level (usually 90,95,99%)
  - We typically denote the confidence level `\(1-\alpha\)`
  - `\(\alpha\)` is probability of making a Type 1 error (more about it later)
  - .blue[Example]: if confidence level is 95%, `\(\alpha=0.05\)`
  
--

4. Find the corresponding critical values `\(z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\)`
  - Critical values are such that `\(P(-z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}&lt;Z&lt;z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}})=1-\alpha\)`
  - .blue[Example]: if confidence level is 95%, `\(z_\frac{\alpha}{2}=z_{0.025}=1.96\)`
--

5. Construct the confidence interval as:
`$$\{\bar{x}- z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}*\frac{s}{\sqrt n}, \bar{x}+ z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}*\frac{s}{\sqrt n}\}$$`


---
### Finding Critical Values

- Suppose confidence interval is 99%. 
- Then `\(\alpha=0.01\)`
- We are looking for `\(z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\)` such that:
`$$P(-z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}&lt;Z&lt;z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}})=0.99$$`
&lt;img src="C_3_slides_b_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-2.png" width="100%" /&gt;

--
$$P(Z&gt;z_{0.005})=0.005 \qquad\text{or}\qquad P(Z&lt;z_{0.005})=0.995 $$

### Finding Critical Values

`\(P(Z&lt;z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}})=0.995\)` 
`\(z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\)`, is 99.5% quantile of standard normal `\(\rightarrow\)` `\(z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}=2.58\)`

### Constructing CI: example
Let's calculate 90% CI for average price of listing with grade&gt;4.5

1. Take an IID sample 
  - `\(n=100\)` `\(\checkmark\)`

--
2. Calculate mean `\(\bar{x}\)` and standard deviation `\(s\)`
  - `\(\bar{x}=\)` 1245.43 and `\(s=\)` 961.9

--
3. Pick confidence level
  - We pick 90%, so `\(\alpha=0.1\)`
  
--

4. Find the corresponding critical values `\(z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\)`
  - Find `\(z_\frac{\alpha}{2}\)` such that `\(P(Z&gt;z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}})=0.05\)` (or `\(P(Z&lt;z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}})=0.95\)`)
  - `\(z_{0.05}=1.65\)`
--

5. Construct the confidence interval as:
`$$\small \{\bar{x}- z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}*\frac{s}{\sqrt n}, \bar{x}+ z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}*\frac{s}{\sqrt n}\}$$`
`$$\small \{1245.43- 1.65\frac{961.9}{\sqrt{100}}, 1245.43+ 1.65\frac{961.9}{\sqrt 100}\}$$`

---
### Interpreting confidence intervals

`$$\small CI_{90}=\{1086.64, 1404.22\}$$`

How do we interpret a 90% confidence interval we computed?

- **Correct Interpretation**
  - We are 90% confident that the interval captures the true mean
  - We are 90% confident that the true mean price of listings with grade&gt;4.5 is between 1086.64 and 1404.22
  
--

- **Incorrect**
  - With 90% probability the true mean is between 1086.64 and 1404.22
      - Computed interval is not-random and true mean is not random, so can't make probabilistic statements.
      - Interval is a function of random variables only **before** we draw a sample and make any computation.
      - After we have a sample, nothing is random. The true mean is either between 1086.64 and 1404.22 or not.


---

### Shape of confidence intervals

Confidence intervals `\(\small \{\bar{x}- z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}*\frac{s}{\sqrt n}, \bar{x}+ z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}*\frac{s}{\sqrt n}\}\)` are wider when: 
- Confidence level is higher (99% is wider than 90%)
- When `\(n\)` is small
- When `\(\sigma\)` is large

### Practice

Suppose we want to know what is the average commute time for ITAM students. We take a sample of 60 students. We calculate sample mean to be `\(\bar{x}=23\)` and sample standard deviation to be `\(s=8\)`. Calculate 99% confidence interval and say whether interpratation is correct:

--
- We are 99% confident that the average commute of these 60 students is between  (20.3364, 25.6636)

--
  - .red[False]
--

- We are 99% confident that the average commute of all ITAM students is between (20.3364, 25.6636)

--
  - .green[True]
--

-  A 95% cofidence interval would be wider

--
  - .red[False]
--

- 95% of random samples would have mean between (20.3364, 25.6636)

--
  - .red[False]
--

- 95% of random samples would capture the true mean

--
  - .green[True]
--

- With 95% probability true mean is between this and this (20.3364, 25.6636)

--
  - .red[False]
---

### What critical values?

When should we use critical values from Normal Distribution?


1. Original distribution (of `\(X\)`) is not normal: 

  - If `\(n&gt;30\)` - you can use critical values from normal distribution
  
  - If `\(n&lt;30\)` - you are screwed


--
2. Original distribution (of `\(X\)`) is normal: 

  - If you know `\(\sigma\)`, you can use critical values from normal ( `\(n\)` doesn't matter)
      - If `\(X\)` is normal, then use `\(\sigma\)` instead of `\(s\)` and `\(\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n}} \sim N(0,1)\)` 

  - If you don't know `\(\sigma\)` but `\(n&gt;30\)`, you can use critical values from normal
      - CLT kicks in

  - If you don't know `\(\sigma\)` and `\(n&lt;30\)`, you use critical values from .blue[student's t].
      - `\(\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt n}}\)` is not normal. `\(s\)` is not a good approx. of `\(\sigma\)` when `\(n\)` is low
    


---
### What's  Student's t?

If `\(X_1\)`, `\(X_2\)`, . . . , `\(X_n\)` are i.i.d. from `\(N(µ, σ)\)`, then
`$$T =\frac{\bar{X} − µ}{s/\sqrt n}$$`
Where `\(s\)` is sample standard deviation. 

T has a student's t distribution with n−1 degrees of freedom
`$$T \sim t_{n-1}$$`


---
### What's  Student's t?

- Bell shaped and symmetric around 0 
- More spread out - heavier tails, more uncertainty (because we don't know standard deviation)
- Shape determined by the degrees of freedom. 
  - As n increases (and hence degrees of freedom), it tends to standard normal (as it should by CLT!)
  - Less uncertainty because we are better at estimating standard deviation

### Student's t critical values

Finding critical values for student's t distribution:

1. Determine what is the right number of degrees of freedom ( `\(n-1\)` )!
2. Determine what's your confidence level and your `\((1-\alpha)\)`
  - From this figure out `\(\alpha/2\)`
  
3. Find the percentile such that 

`$$P(T&gt;t_{\frac{\alpha}{2},\underbrace{n-1}_{d.f.}})=\frac{\alpha}{2} \qquad\text{or}\qquad P(T&lt;t_{\frac{\alpha}{2},n-1})=1-\frac{\alpha}{2}$$`

&lt;img src="C_3_slides_b_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="100%" /&gt;


---
### Example

- `\(n=10 \rightarrow df=9\)`
- Confidence level is 95% `\(\rightarrow1-\alpha=0.95\)` and `\(\frac{\alpha}{2}=0.025\)`
- What's `\(t_{0.025,9}\)` such that `\(P(T&lt;t_{0.025,9})=0.975\)`
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=t_student_table.png width="1000"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

- `\(n=10 \rightarrow df=9\)`
- Confidence level is 95% `\(\rightarrow1-\alpha=0.95\)` and `\(\frac{\alpha}{2}=0.025\)`
- What's `\(t_{0.025,9}\)` such that `\(P(T&lt;t_{0.025,9})=0.975\)`

&lt;img src="C_3_slides_b_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="100%" /&gt;
- Once we have critical value, we construct the CI as before:

`$$\small \{\bar{x}- t_{\frac{\alpha}{2},n-1}*\frac{s}{\sqrt n}, \bar{x}+ t_{\frac{\alpha}{2},n-1}*\frac{s}{\sqrt n}\}$$`

### Practice:

Your company implemented free shipping for a random group of customers. They want to know whether it increased spending.
Here is your data:

$157.80, $192.45, $210.20, $175.60, $198.30, $180.90, $205.75, $185.20, $177.40, $195.60 


a) Calculate 90% confidence interval. What assumptions you need?

--

- Hint 1: `\(\sum_ix_i=1869.80\)`
- Hint 2: `\(\sum_ix_i^2=361752.55\)`

--
b) Average spending without free shipping is $182, can say anything about whether free shipping increased spending?

### Confidence Intervals for Variance

- Suppose `\(X_1, X_2, ...X_n\)` come from normal distribution
- The sampling distribution of the sample variance is `\(S^2=\frac{\sum_i(X_i-\bar{X})^2}{n-1}\)` is: 

`$$\small \frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2}\sim\chi_{n-1}$$`
--
- We will use the fact that:  
`$$\small P(\chi_{0.025,n-1}&lt;\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2}&lt;\chi_{0.975,n-1})=0.95$$`

&lt;img src="C_3_slides_b_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="100%" /&gt;

---
### Confidence Intervals for Variance

How we use it to construct the confidence interval?

`\begin{align*}
0.95&amp;= P(\chi_{0.025,n-1}&lt;\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2}&lt;\chi_{0.975,n-1}) \\
&amp;= P(\frac{1}{\chi_{0.975,n-1}} &lt; \frac{\sigma^2}{(n-1)S^2} &lt; \frac{1}{\chi_{0.025,n-1}}) \\
&amp;= P(\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\chi_{0.975,n-1}} &lt; \sigma^2 &lt; \frac{(n-1)S^2}{\chi_{0.025,n-1}})
\end{align*}`

--
So more generally, the confidence interval for the sample variance is 

`$$CI_{1-\alpha}=\{\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\chi_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2},n-1}}, \frac{(n-1)S^2}{\chi_{\frac{\alpha}{2},n-1}}\}$$`
- Where `\(\chi_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2},n-1}\)` and `\(\chi_{\frac{\alpha}{2},n-1}\)` are quantiles of `\(\chi_{n-1}\)` distribution, such that `\(P(X&lt;\chi_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2},n-1})=1-\frac{\alpha}{2}\)` and `\(P(X&lt;\chi_{\frac{\alpha}{2},n-1})=\frac{\alpha}{2}\)`
- You can read them off the tables

---
### Practice

Suppose you produce sausages. As a quality control, you measure the level of fat in your sausages. You take a random sample of 12 sausages and you find the variance of 20  ( `\(grams^2\)` ). Find 99% confidence interval for the variance. What assumptions you need?
